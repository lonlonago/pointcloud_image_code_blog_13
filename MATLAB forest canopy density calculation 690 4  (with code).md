#  I. Introduction 

>  The canopy density is the percentage of the forest area that the vertical projection of the canopy of the stand accounts for. In forest management, canopy density is an important indicator to determine the intensity of tending and harvesting, and it is also an indispensable factor for forest stock estimation. The calculation process is also relatively simple, that is, for a statistical unit, canopy density can be calculated as the ratio of vegetation points to the total number of points. Similar to the calculation of clearance rate, points greater than the height threshold in the calculation process can be considered as vegetation points.
