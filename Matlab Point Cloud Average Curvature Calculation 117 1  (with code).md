#  I. Introduction 

>  Mean curvature definition: is the average value of two orthogonal curvatures perpendicular to each other at any point on a curved surface in space. If a set of orthogonal curvatures perpendicular to each other can be expressed as K1, K2, then the average curvature is: K = (K1 + K2)/2. Based on this, we will continue the content in the previous blog (Matlab point cloud principal curvature calculation) and calculate the average curvature of the principal curvature of the point cloud.
