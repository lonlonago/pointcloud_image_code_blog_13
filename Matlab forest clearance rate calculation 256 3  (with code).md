#  I. Introduction 

>  Gap rate refers to the death of old trees in forest communities or the death of dominant tree species in the mature stage due to accidental factors, resulting in gaps in the forest canopy. The calculation formula is simple after all, that is, the ratio of ground points to the total number of forest points.
